# Error call {#err-call}

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

Don't display the call when generating an error message. Either use `stop(call. = FALSE)` or `rlang::abort()` to avoid it. 

Why not? Typically doesn't display enough information to find the source of the call (since most errors are not from top-level function calls), and you can expect the most people to either use RStudio, or know how to call `traceback()`.
